## What is the scientific background?

On 2008 an innovative study by Jeroen Raes and Peer Bork first argued that is <i>"time to consider molecular systems biology at the ecosystem level"</i>. The era of <b>eco-systems biology</b> had already started.

<b>'Omics technologies</b>, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics have ensured an overall characterization of microbial ecosystems.

The data produced along with the information gathered are valuable. In the case of microbial ecology, their <b>integration</b> shall contribute in elucidating crucial parts of the <b>ecological functioning</b>. 

A similar integration to this, are the <b>STRING</b> and <b>STITCH</b> databases. 
Both they systematically collect pieces of information by employing data integration and statistical analysis techniques. 

As also Raes and Bork pointed out in their study, the integration of such networks and merging with the macroecological theory may help us in our attempt to understand the wiring of the main biological systems.



## Which is our aim?
<i>Process, environment, organism (PREGO)</i> is a systems-biology approach to elucidate ecosystem function at the microbial dimension. 
To understand how ecosystems function it is fundamental to understand <i>what</i> processes occur in which
environments (<i>where</i>), and which organisms carry them out (<i>who</i>).
Its main motivation is to provide a one-stop-shop for researchers interested in searching and visually exploring such 
<i>what-where-who</i> associations.
