## Text mining (WP1)
### Objectives
* to extract *process-environment-organism* associations buried in the scientific literature, free text descriptions of biological database records, and in dedicated community web pages
* to develop a named entity recognition module to identify environmental process mentions in text


## Knowledge gathering and association extraction (WP2)
### Objectives
* to collect *process-environment-organism* evidence from public data record metadata and computational analysis record annotations
* to assign a confidence score to each annotation based on its evidence source


## Homology-based annotation transfer (WP3)
### Objectives
* to predict (based on sequence homology) process and environment annotations for novel sequences and/or sequences with insufficient metadata
* to support sequence-based searches against the PREGO platform
* to facilitate the upload of in-house sequences (along with their metadata) in the PREGO platform

## Association unification (WP4)
### Objectives
* to unify the calculated process-environment-organism associations
* to devise an overall confidence scoring scheme for the PREGO associations
* to manage and store the unified associations in a database
* to support the periodic update of the PREGO associations and liaison to emerging data infrastructures


## Association presentation (WP5)
### Objectives
* to make PREGO accessible to researchers via a web platform
* to faciliate text and sequence searches to the PREGO process-environment-organism associations
* to present the confidence and supporting evidence of retrieved associations
* to present process-environment-organism associations as networks
* to support enrichment analysis and network-based function exploration
* to provide developers and data analysis with programmatic access and bulk download options

## Project management (WP6)
### Objectives
* To establish the PREGO team and to purchase and install the PREGO dedicated server
* To organize a hands-on meeting to establish the scientific and technical frameworks of the project
* To monitor, log, and coordinate the project's activities
* To link to a network of collaborations in academia and private companies to seek future funding

## Dissemination, publication, training and outreach (WP7)
### Objectives
* To maintain a blog and social media spreading the word on PREGO aim, progress and activities
* To submit PREGO open access publications
* To present PREGO at an international bioinformatics, biodiversity informatics workshop
* To teach PREGO and its underlying methodologies to local collaborators, bioinformatics course modules, and to national data infrastructure training activities
