## Text mining
* to extract *process-environment-organism* associations buried in the scientific literature, free text descriptions of biological database records, and in dedicated community web pages
* to develop a named entity recognition module to identify environmental process mentions in text

## Knowledge gathering and association extraction
* to collect *process-environment-organism* evidence from public data record metadata and computational analysis record annotations
* to assign a confidence score to each annotation based on its evidence source

## Homology-based annotation transfer
* to predict (based on sequence homology) process and environment annotations for novel sequences and/or sequences with insufficient metadata
* to support sequence-based searches against the PREGO platform
* to facilitate the upload of in-house sequences (along with their metadata) in the PREGO platform

## Association unification
* to unify the calculated process-environment-organism associations
* to devise an overall confidence scoring scheme for the PREGO associations
* to manage and store the unified associations in a database
* to support the periodic update of the PREGO associations and liaison to emerging data infrastructures

## Association presentation
* to make PREGO accessible to researchers via a web platform
* to faciliate text and sequence searches to the PREGO process-environment-organism associations
* to present the confidence and supporting evidence of retrieved associations
* to present process-environment-organism associations as networks
* to support enrichment analysis and network-based function exploration
* to provide developers and data analysis with programmatic access and bulk download options
