PEMA, our metabarcoding pipeline for four marker genes was recently published on [GigaScience](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/3/giaa022/5803335).

You can find its main page on [GitHub](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema) and its containers both on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hariszaf/pema/) and [SingularityHub](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/2295).

Soon, PEMA will be also available as part of the [LifeWatch ERIC](https://www.lifewatch.eu/) Internal joint initiative for ARMS
and of the [Elixir - Greece Cloud Infrastructure](https://egci-beta.imsi.athenarc.gr/). 

Feel free to contact us regarding PEMA on its [Gitter helpdesk community](https://gitter.im/pema-helpdesk/community#).
