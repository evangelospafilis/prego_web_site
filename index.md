## Aim
*Process, environment, organism (PREGO)* is a systems-biology approach to elucidate ecosystem function at the microbial dimension. 
To understand how ecosystems function it is fundamental to understand *what* processes occur in which environments (*where*), and which organisms carry them out (*who*).
Its main motivation is to provide a one-stop-shop for researchers interested in searching and visually exploring such *what - where - who* associations.
