## Aim

*Process, environment, organism (PREGO)* is a systems-biology approach to elucidate ecosystem function at the microbial dimension. 
To understand how ecosystems function it is fundamental to understand *what* processes occur in which environments (*where*), and which organisms carry them out (*who*).
Its main motivation is to provide a one-stop-shop for researchers interested in searching and visually exploring such *what - where - who* associations.

Scripts where additional libraries have been used are subject to their individual licenses.

[prego_gathering_data](https://github.com/lab42open-team/prego_gathering_data){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, here are the scripts that gather data from resources and extract associations.

[prego_daemons](https://github.com/lab42open-team/prego_daemons), here are the scripts that periodically update the PREGO knowledge base.

[prego_mappings](https://github.com/lab42open-team/prego_mappings), here are the scripts that transform all identifiers to the ones that PREGO has adopted.

[prego_statistics](https://github.com/lab42open-team/prego_statistics), here are the scripts which count all contents of PREGO and summarize them in the different taxonomic ranks.
